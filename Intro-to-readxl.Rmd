# Learning `readxl`

We are working with data in readxl and it's going to be amazing!

We're going to use packages:

- tidyverse
- readxl
- writexl
- here

```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(writexl)
library(here)

# install.packages ("package_name")
```

### Read in fish counts

```{r}
#### Read in the fish_counts_curated.csv
fish_counts <- read_csv(here("R-workshop-data","fish_counts_curated.csv"))
```
